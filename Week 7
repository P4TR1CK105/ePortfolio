Threat Intelligence Report

Name: CL0P Ransomware (https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/366539278/Ransomware-actors-exploiting-MoveIt-Transfer-vulnerability)

Associated Groups: TA505 (https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-158a)

Description: The threat group CL0P Ransomware first appeared in February 2019. Derived on the CryptoMix ransomware strain, CL0P was utilised as a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) in extensive spear-phishing campaigns that circumvented system defences by using a 
validated and digitally signed binary. In the past, CL0P was well-known for adopting the "double extortion" strategy, which involved taking victim data, encrypting it, refusing to let victims access again, and posting exfiltrated information on Tor through the CL0P^_-LEAKS
website. 2019 saw the usage of CL0P ransomware by TA505 actors as the last payload of a phishing campaign involving a document with macro functionality that downloaded SDBot and FlawedGrace using a Get2 malware dropper. (https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisor

Techniques: 
Server Software Component: Web Shell (T1505.003): CL0P Ransomware deploys a web shell for data exfiltration purposes following the exploitation of the flaw. A Web shell is a Web script that is placed on an openly accessible Web server to allow an adversary to access the 
Web server as a gateway into a network.(https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/003/) (https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/366539278/Ransomware-actors-exploiting-MoveIt-Transfer-vulnerability)
Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location (T1036.005) CL0P Ransomware deploys web shells are disguised with file names for human.aspx, which is a legitimate component of the MFT software. Adversaries may match or approximate the name or location of legitimate files 
or resources when naming/placing them. This is done for the sake of evading defenses and observation (https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005/) (https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/366539278/Ransomware-actors-exploiting-MoveIt-Transfer-vulnerability)

Software Name: Lemurloot

Group Association: Lemurloot has been deployed by CL0P Ransomware to web shell to facilitate data theft following the exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability in the MoveIt Transfer software. Lemurloot allowed CL0P actors to establish persistent access to compromised 
systems and execute commands for data exfiltration. By deploying this web shell, CL0P could efficiently steal sensitive information from victims after gaining initial access through the SQL injection vulnerability. (https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories

Platform: Windows 

Techniques: 
Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190) : CL0P Ransomware uses stolen exploits a SQL injection zero-day vulnerability after the exploitation of CVE-2023-0669. The adversaries may attempt to exploit a weakness in an Internet-facing host or system to initially
access a network. The weakness in the system can be a software bug, a temporary glitch, or a misconfiguration. (https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/366539278/Ransomware-actors-exploiting-MoveIt-Transfer-vulnerability) (https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/)
Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486): Clop ransomware actors exploited CVE-2023-0669, which lead to a series of data theft. Attackers encrypt critical data and demand a ransom for decryption, which is commonly used in extortion operations like ransomware attacks.
